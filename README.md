# Problem

- "I am having problems with finding good cultural events or concerts in my city."

# Description

This project was the Final Project challenge for our bootcamp and we had one week to conceive, design and develop a fully functional mobile application that could solve a specific problem that we envisioned. 
We analysed the requirements in order to solve our problem, created a data structure and software architecture that would allow for us to succeed. The project's backend was created based on the three-layer architecture.
We think we did, based on our experience at the time.

# Updates
In the future, should we decide to pick this up again, a couple of things we thought about changing could be:
- Create our own caroussel instead of using Splide JS as it wasn't as customizeable as we expected.
- Fix the memory issues related to algorythm speed.
- Transition to Next.js as it faster.
